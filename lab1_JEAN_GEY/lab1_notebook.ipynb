    "**Objectives**: numerically simulate basic Markov chains (discrete time and discrete state space).\n",

    "**Setup**: after retrieving the resources for the lab on moodle:\n",
    "- place the .zip archive in a local folder (Computer -> Documents/Python/);\n",
    "- unzip the archive .zip;\n",
    "- rename the folder with the convention lab1_Name1_Name2\n",
    "- duplicate the notebook file and rename it lab1_Name1_Name2.ipynb;\n",
    "- [**optional, possibly needed if working from Centrale's machines**]\n",
    "    - create a `lab1` conda environment from the provided `requirement.txt` file\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    conda create --name=lab1 --file=requirement.txt\n",
    "    conda activate lab1\n",
    "    # do not forget to deactivate the environment if needed\n",
    "    # you can remove the environment once you are done\n",
    "    conda env remove --name=lab1\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - launch jupyter notebook (the python environment will be the one from the conda environment `lab1`)\n",
    "- at the end of the session, do not forget to transfer your work to your own network space if you are working on a machine from the school (do not leave your work on the C: drive).\n",

    "**Assessment** &#8594; grade /20 (possibly converted later on to a grade ranging from F to A (A+))\n",

    "This lab session will be evaluated, based on your answer to the exercises reported in a Jupyter notebook (e.g., this one) and any additional `.py` file produced. In particular:\n",
    "\n",
    "- make sure the notebook you produce is properly annotated: each exercise should be introduced by a short sentence summarizing its context. Concisely answer each question from the guideline. \n",
    "- **relate the numerical results to the theory covered during the lecture** whenever appropriate;\n",
    "- **codes without any explanations (in a text cell) will not be considered as a complete answer**, and will only be attributed a fraction opf the grade attributed to the question.\n",
    "- any code produced should be commented whenever appropriate;\n",
    "- include appropriate axis labels and a relevant title to each figure reported in the notebook;\n",
    "- **document any function you introduce (using docstrings)**, and comment your code whenever appropriate (see, *e.g.*, [PEP 8 style recommendations](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)). \n",
    "     - use a reference docstring style, *e.g.*, the [google docstring style](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html).\n",
    "- **give a clear structure to your notebook**: longer theoretical explanations should be reported in markdown cells. Include LaTeX equations to improve the clarity of the document.\n",

    "- Code clarity / conciseness / documentation\n",
